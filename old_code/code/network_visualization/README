This folder contains the work I've done on producing static network visualizations. The code here is mostly 1-1.5 years old; this was mostly before/concurrent with KNALIJ... we wanted to have some way of visualizing what we had already produced. 

example_plots.R & exmaple_global_plots.R contain examples of generating plots. 
The code here won't really work (because the directory structure have not been adjusted.) This also will have relatively low priority, but if there is a need for these, I can increase its priority.
