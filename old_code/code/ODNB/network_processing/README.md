(Lawrence): I haven't done any work regarding conversion of end results into web format. You're free to do whatever you wish here; it wouldn't be too hard to convert the R-format of confidence estimates into a .csv. 

Various iterations of converting some segment of the data for other people (researchers, web interface data) are going to be stored in the folder OLD_process_data_for_others. These files will NOT be kept up to date (they may expect old directory structure, etc.), but will be kept here for posterity / reference.
