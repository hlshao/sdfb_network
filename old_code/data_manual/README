dataset_Oct62014.csv -- This is the set of nodes that should be in the fitted model. [TODO: Add more documentation for the exact file contents where it may not be clear]

I've made fields for search names (first name surname, as well as alternate names). There's a column with all the search names separated by commas and I've also split the search names into multiple columns so that each one has its own field - I wasn't sure which would be more convenient for you.  It probably doesn't matter for the purposes of your algorithm, but for the birth/death dates, AF/BF/CA/IN stand for after, before, circa, and in.  A few of the cells have multiple values (i.e. BF/IN = before or in).
